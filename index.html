        I am a prolific leader who has a background within financial services, banking and the tech space. I have a bachelor of commerce in accounting coupled with CPAs and I am graduating with an MBA in June 2021. The MBA from <a href="https://www.hkr.se/en/">Kristianstad University, Sweden</a> which has a focus on sustainability, international business, auditing and control fields. Over the past few years, I have been able to encourage and grow individuals whom I have worked with by inspiring them to be the best versions of themselves.
